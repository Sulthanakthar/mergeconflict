<p>In the early Muslim world, ultimate power and authority was theoretically held by the caliph, who was considered the leader of the caliphate. The increasing political fragmentation of the Muslim world after the 8th century, however, challenged this consensus. Local governors with administrative authority held the title of amīr (أمير, traditionally "commander" or "emir", later also "prince") and were appointed by the caliph, but in the 9th century some of these became de facto independent rulers who founded their own dynasties, such as the Aghlabids and Tulunids.[7] Towards the late 10th century, the term "sultan" begins to be used to denote an individual ruler with practically sovereign authority,[8] although the early evolution of the term is complicated and difficult to establish.[6]</p></html>
